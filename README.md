# Today or Never - To-Do List App

**Today or Never** is a minimalist, focus-driven To-Do List web application designed to help you prioritize and complete your most important tasks each day. Inspired by productivity principles like "less is more," this app encourages users to focus on only three key tasks daily.

---

## Features

- **Add tasks:** Add up to **three tasks per day** to stay focused.
- **Prioritize tasks:** Confirm your tasks before starting to ensure focus on what matters most.
- **Task management:**  
  - Mark tasks as completed with checkboxes.  
  - Delete tasks.  
  - Reorder tasks with up and down buttons.
- **Focus mode:** Once tasks are confirmed, the app locks input and allows you to focus on completing tasks **one at a time**.
- **Persistence:** Tasks are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so your list is preserved even after refreshing the page.
- **Popup messages:** Friendly reminders guide you if you exceed task limits or need confirmation.
- **Responsive design:** Works well on both desktop and mobile screens.
